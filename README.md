Co2meter uses ESP8266, SenseAir S8 and SI7021 to display CO2 level, time with NTP updates, temperature and humidity.

As enclosure I used chinese wood clock from Aliexpress that drives led display using TM1639.
Device can be powered from any 5V power supply like USB or phone charger and consumes about 100-150 mA depending on current activity.
